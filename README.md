<h1 align="center">iremono</h1>

iremono is a self-hosted cloud storage built with node js and react both of which are powered by typescript. iremono means **a container that can hold anything** in Japanese. It has been developed with the purpose of allowing people to manage their own personal data by themselves including myself in trusted environment such as Raspberry Pi. Every file will be encrypted with a encryption key generated by the user. The server will not store the key in the database but only hashed one, guaranteeing that your files are securely stored.
